        <h2>What this product is</h2>
        <p>
          This is an Ayurvedic, plant based cosmetic formulation that focuses on
          supporting dormant hair follicles and thinning hair, especially in women
          with widening hair parts. It reduces hair fall first, then supports
          visible regrowth over time.

      <section id="science" class="section section-alt">
        <h2>Rooted in Ayurveda, guided by hair biology</h2>
        <p>
          The formulation works with the natural hair cycle, aiming to help
          follicles move from resting phase back into growth phase. It does not
          create new follicles, but is designed to reactivate existing ones that
          have become less active.
